## Meet Ulli: a 1991 VW T4

Born as a pandemic child to me, i bought this van in early 2021. 
Then it served as a therapeutic blowoff project next to a long and exhausting bachelor thesis.
It came with all the bells and whistles, a full kitchen, a very fashionable all-grey carpet interior and had some water damage. 

Out of over 30 cars that i considered online, my dad, who i place my trust in when it comes to cars, only approved this one. 

So there it was, my first ever car. 
To make it habitable, quite some weekends passed and did extensive research on youtube and forums.
With an old van and a not quite unlimited budget, there is always the question of problem selection and prioritization. 
At the time, seems like my priorities were in the sound department, my first order of business was studio speakers in a surround configuration. In hindsight, not the most efficient use of my money. At least i didnt install a subwoofer or stuff like that.

Next came the kitchen, which i left structurally identical, i decided to scrape of the carpet and vinyl and just plain paint the kitchen cabinettes while leaving the doors naked wood.

The it was insulation time, we are talking february in an unheated workshop. Trying to keep things organic, the plan was to go for cork  panels, like the ones used in homes. With the surfaces i had, turned out that would easily add over 100kg to the van, so i went the conventional way with xps foam. I still really wanted the cork, so i used thinner strips for the ceiling and the floor.
