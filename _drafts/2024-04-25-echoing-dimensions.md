## Echoing Dimensions

## The space

[Kunstraum Potsdamer Straße](https://www.stw.berlin/kultur/kunstraum/kunsträume/)

The exhibition is situated in an old parking garage, owned and operated by the studierendenwerk Berlin. The space is a large, open room with a rather low ceiling and a concrete floor. Several Nooks and separees can create intimate experiences within the space. The space is not heated and has no windows. The walls are made of concrete and the ceiling is made of concrete.

As a group, we are 10 people, each with amazing projects surrounding audiovisual installations.
