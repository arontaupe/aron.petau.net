## Echoing Dimensions

## The space

[Kunstraum Potsdamer Straße](https://www.stw.berlin/kultur/kunstraum/kunsträume/)

The exhibition is situated in an old parking garage, owned and operated by the studierendenwerk Berlin. The space is a large, open room with a rather low ceiling and a concrete floor. Several Nooks and separees can create intimate experiences within the space. The space is not heated and has no windows. The walls are made of concrete and the ceiling is made of concrete.

As a group, we are 10 people, each with amazing projects surrounding audiovisual installations.

Exhibition text finally fixed:

```markdown
Sound, as a fundamental element of everyday experience, envelopes us in the cacophony of city life - car horns, the chatter of pedestrians, the chirping of birds, the rustle of leaves in the wind, notifications, alarms and the constant hum of radio waves, signals and frequencies. These sounds, together make up the noise of our life, often pass by, fleeting and unnoticed. 

The engagement with sound through active listening holds the potential to process the experience of the self and its surroundings. This is the idea of “Echoing Dimensions”: Once you engage with something, it gives back to you: Whether it is the rhythmic cadence of a heartbeat, a  flowing symphony of urban activity or the hoofbeats of a running horse, minds and bodies construct and rebuild scenes and narratives while sensing and processing the sounds that surround them, that pass next and through them.

The exhibition "Echoing Dimensions" takes place at Kunstraum Potsdamer Straße gallery’s underground space and exhibits artworks by 12 Berlin based artists, who investigate in their artistic practice ‘intentional listening’ using sound, video and installation, and invites to navigate attentiveness by participatory exploration. Each artwork in the exhibition revolves around different themes in which historical ideas resonate, political-personal narratives are being re-conceptualized and cultural perspectives are examined. The exhibition's common thread lies in its interest into the complexities of auditory perception, inviting viewers to consider the ways in which sound shapes our memories, influences our culture, and challenges our understanding of space and power dynamics.
