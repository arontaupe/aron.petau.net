## SDR-RTL and the public sphere

Recently, I stumbled upon an [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/) and was fascinated by the possibilities of software-defined radio.
I got me an NESDR Smart v5 and started to play around with it.
With the help of [GQRX](https://gqrx.dk/) I was able to listen to the radio and also to decode some digital signals.

I found some Walkie-Talkies and was able to listen to them.
I also found the Radio timing signal at 60kHz and found several mystical signals floating around us.

This got me thinking about Radio as the embodiment of the public sphere. A pervasive medium that is all around us and that we can not escape. The signals are there, even if we do not listen to them. Simply by deciding to pick up what is there, since an SDR can do a lot more than a simple consumer radio, we are potentially subversive through listening. 

The Radio as a subversive praxis is something that I want to explore further.
The act of transmitting a pirate radio signal could be quite obviously subversive, with the listening it is trickier. 

How can listening to police radio be a defiant act? It is illegal in Germany after all, to listen to the BOS (Beh√∂rden und Organisationen mit Sicherheitsaufgaben) radio.
