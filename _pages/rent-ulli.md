This is a work in Progress. Informations on here are subject to change.
{: .notice--danger}

## The general stuff

The car is a 1991 VW T4, with a 2.0l **Benzin** (petrol) engine.
That means roughly 80 PS. No mountains and offroading for you in there.

## Propellant

The car takes either **Super** (95), **Super Plus** (98) or **E10**.
{: .notice--danger}

The Car uses about 10-12l/100km, when never going beyond 90 km/h.
Otherwise it uses about 12-15l/100km.

The tank is 85l, so you can go about 750km on one tank.
The tank needle is broken, so you have to use the trip meter to know how much fuel is left.
Always refill completely, otherwise you will have no clue about your range.

Please remember to reset the meter after filling up.
{: .notice--danger}

The car is a manual, so you need to know how to drive stick.
There is no Servolenkung (power steering), so it is a bit harder to steer.
There is a trailer hitch for up to 1000 kg total. This means a standard 750kg trailer is fine, a complete rv trailer is not.
The car is a 4 seater.

The car is insured for everyone over 25 years old, who has a valid drivers license.
It has Teilkasko, which means that you are insured for everything, except for damage to the car itself.

## Electricity

The van has it's own solar system, meaning that in summer you can usually go off-grid.
There is some 12v plugs and several USB and USB-C plugs. No 230v plugs. If you need 230v, that is only possible with grid connection (Landstromanschluss). All necessary cables are on board.
Please plan accordingly.

The solar system functions automatically and has an automatic shut-off, so you can't drain the battery. In case you wanna monitor the battery, you can use the [Victron App](https://www.victronenergy.com/live/victronconnect:start) to connect to the solar system via Bluetooth. Ask me for the pin.
For the Analogue people, there is a battery monitor in the car, that shows the current battery voltage. It is right next to the driver seat and can read the front starter battery and the support back battery.
Anything below 11.5V is considered empty and you should start the car to recharge the battery. There is a battery booster, which will charge both batteries while driving.

For increased solar capacity, take out the folded panels, plug their cable into the adapter at the rear under the exhaust pipe and place the panels in the sun. The solar system will automatically use the additional power.

## Kitchen

The kitchen is equipped with a 2 flame gas stove and a sink with running water.
The water is stored in a 15l tank, which is filled from the outside. Using it awarely, it can  last for about 3 days (2 people).

Gas is standard 5kg grey gas bottles, which can be exchanged at any gas station. There is a bottle in the car, which is usually enough for more than a month of cooking. If you run out, you can exchange it at any gas station.
{: .notice--info}

Kitchen is fully equipped for 2 People.

Always roll the top window down while driving. You will loose the window and its roughly 300 to replace.
{: .notice--danger}

There is a powerful 12v fridge which holds about 30l. It is powered by the solar system and can be used while driving. With enough sun it can run 24/7.

Anything above the setting 3 will freeze your food. Level 2 works for me.
{: .notice--danger}

## Sleeping

The bed is in the high roof and is 1.20m wide and 1.90m long.

There is climbing involved to get up there.
{: .notice--info}

## Heating

The car has a gas heater, which can be used to heat the car. It is not possible to heat the car while driving. The heater is controlled by a thermostat, which is located next to the bed.
To use it, the gas bottle has to be opened and the heater valve (inside the gas bottle compartment) has to be turned on. The heater will then start automatically, when the temperature drops below the set temperature.

There is also a 12v fan in the heater, which can be used to circulate air in the car. Another fan is plug and play and is usually enough in summer.

## How to rent

You can rent the van by sending me an email to [rent-ulli@aronpetau.me](mailto:rent-ulli@aronpetau.me)
I will need the following information:

- Your name
- Your address
- a copy of your drivers license
- the dates you want to rent the car

I will then send you a contract, which you have to sign and send back to me.
Then we can arrange a time for you to pick up the car.

## Costs

The car costs 30€ per day, plus 0.10€ per km.
This factors in my insurance and the taxes I have to pay.

Any damages to the car will be charged to you. A total damage would cost you somewhere around 10.000 Euro, so please be careful. Check your Haftpflichtversicherung (private liability insurance) to see whether it covers rented cars.
