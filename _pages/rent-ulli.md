## Stuff to know
The car is a VW T4, with a 2.0l 
Benzin{: .notice--danger}
engine.
The Car uses about 10-12l/100km, when never going beyond 90 km/h.
Otherwise it uses about 12-15l/100km.

The Tank is 85l, so you can go about 750km on one tank.
The tank needle is broken, so you have to use the trip meter to know how much fuel is left.

Please remember to reset it after filling up.

The car is a manual, so you need to know how to drive stick.
The car is a 4 seater.

The car is insured for everyone over 25 years old, who has a valid drivers license.
It has Teilkasko, which means that you are insured for everything, except for damage to the car itself.

## How to rent
You can rent the van by sending me an email to [rent-a-van@aronpetau.me](mailto:rent-a-van@aronpetau.me)
I will need the following information:

I will then send you a contract, which you have to sign and send back to me.



## Costs
The car costs 30€ per day, plus 0.10€ per km.
This factors in my insurance and the taxes I have to pay.
