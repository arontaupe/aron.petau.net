Here I will collect all the Documentation of the Thought Process

Okay, the task, as I gathered it, is to create a **situation** and a **showing**.
What are those?
Situation :=
	Is some kind of performance
	is unique in time and space
	is interactive

Showing :=
	Is some kind of communication of ideas
	presentation of sorts
	creativity in media is a plus

Constraints:
	has to be analog
	has to utilize the room as space
	has to enhance some aspects of being in space

Takeaways from the first session:
	flexible, schedules are to be adapted on the go
	small groups, randomly distributed
	Lots of people with incredible design and graphics skills, gotta beef up my presentation

The first Situation/Showing is in 2 weeks, Brainstorm is scheduled for Friday with Friedrich
