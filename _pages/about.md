# Introduction

I am Aron, a recent graduate of the bachelors program of Cognitive Science in Osnabr√ºck.
During my very open and broad studies, I focused mostly on Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning, and Philosophy.
The mix of these topics you will find scattered through my [Portfolio](/portfolio/)

I am enthusiastic about many of the topics included there and have developed a fondness of algorithmical problems, philosophical considerations and issues of our society.

I live together with 4 awesome humans, a cat, and two 3D Printers and am currently restaurating a van as my temporary home for the summer before moving to Berlin to start my awesome master's project.

I dream of one day having my own bar with cultural events and am already working on the perfect recipe for [homebrew](/homebrew/) beer. I love experimenting, whether that is in the kitchen, finding a solution to a coding problem or creating useful objects.

I am also passionate about [3D Printing](/printing/) and all of its curious applications, as well as all areas tangent to it.
The interface of technology and the world interests me and coming up with ways for one sphere to interact with the other has now captured me for some years.

I recognize a collosal environmental problem that the current and following generations are faced with, global waste being just one tiny aspect of.
At the same time, I am thoroughly frustrated that I have to pay for the plastic that goes into my printer while I throw the packaging of my food away, being the exact same material.
Even more frustrating are the established norms for recycling that lead to virtually none of the products that I can produce with the printer at home being recyclable.
[Plastic waste](/plastic-recycling/) is no joke and I consider it my personal contribution to try to help advance small scale, decentralized recycling.
I am currently searching for an appropriate place to further my knowledge to automatize the recycling of my own very large collection of failed prints.
