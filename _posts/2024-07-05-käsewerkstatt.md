## Enter the Käsewerkstatt

One day earlier this year I woke up and realized I had a space problem.
I was trying to build out a workshop and tackle ever more advanced and dusty plastic and woodworking projects and after another small run in with my girlfriend after I had repeatedly crossed the "No-Sanding-and-Linseed-Oiling-Policy" in our Living Room, it was time to do something about it.
I am based in Berlin right now and the housing market is going completely haywire over here ( quick shoutout in solidarity with [Deutsche Wohnen und Co enteignen](https://dwenteignen.de/)).
End of the song: I won't be able to afford to rent a small workshop anywhere near berlin anytime soon. As you will notice in some other projects, I am quite opposed to the Idea that it should be considered normal to park ones car in the middle of the city on public spaces, for example [Autoimmunitaet](/autoimmunitaet), [Commoning Cars](/commoning-cars) or [Dreams of Cars](/dreams-of-cars).

So, the idea was born, to regain that space as habitable zone, taking back usable space from parked cars.
I was gonna install a mobile workshop within a trailer.
Ideally, the trailer should be lockable and have enough standing and working space.
As it turns out, Food Trailers fulfill these criteria quite nicely. So I got out on a quest, finding the cheapest food trailer available in germany.

6 weeks later, I found it near munich, got it and started immediately renovating it.

Due to developments in parallel, I was already invited to sell food and have the ofgficial premiere at the Bergfest, a Weekend Format in Brandenburg an der Havel, initiated and organized by [Zirkus Creativo](https://zirkus-creativo.de). Many thanks for the invitation here again!

So on it went, I spent some afternoons renovating and outfitting the trailer, and did my first ever shopping at Metro, a local B2B Foodstuffs Market.

Meanwhile, I got into all the paperwork and did all the necessary instructional courses and certificates.
The first food I wanted to sell was Raclette on fresh bread, a swiss dish that is quite popular in germany.
For the future, the trailer is supposed to tend more towards vegan dishes, as a first tryout I also sold a bruschetta combo. This turned out great, since the weather was quite hot and the bruschetta was a nice and light snack, while I could use the same type of bread for the raclette.

The event itself was great, and, in part at least, started paying off the trailer.

We encountered lots of positive feedback and I am looking forward to the next event. So, in case you want to have a foodtruck at your event, hit me up!
