## How do we design our Commute? 
In the context of the Design and Computation Studio Course Milli Keil, Marla Gaiser and me developed a concept for a playful critique of the traffic decisions we take and the idols we embrace. 
It should open up questions of whether the generations to come should still grow up playing on traffic carpets that are mostly grey and whether the [Letzte Generation](https://letztegeneration.org), a political climate activist group in germany receives enough recognition for their acts. 

A call for solidarity. 


## Autoimmunitaet

Autoimmunity is a term for defects, that are produced by a dysfunctional self-tolerance of a system. This dysfunction causes the immune system to stop accepting certain parts of itself and build antibodies instead. An invitation for a speculative playful interaction.
