## Photography

In the context of the course "Fotografie Elementar" with Sebastian Herold I developed a small concept of urban intervention.\
The results were exhibited at the UdK Rundgang 2023 and are also visible here.

## Dreams of Cars

These are not just cars.\
They are Sport Utility Vehicles.\
What might they have had as hopes and dreams on the production line?\
Do they dream of drifting in dusty deserts?\
Climbing steep rocky canyon roads?\
Sliding down sun-drenched dunes?\
Discovering remote pathways in natural grasslands?\
Nevertheless, they did end up in the parking spots here in Berlin.

What drove them here?
