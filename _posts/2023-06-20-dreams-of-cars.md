## Photography
In the context of the course "Fotografie 'Elementar'" i developed a small concept of a urban intervention. The results were exibited at the UdK Rundgang 2023 and also visible here. 

## Dreams of Cars 

These are not just cars. 
They are Sport Utility Vehicles. What might they have had as hopes and dreams on the production line? 
Do they dream of drifting in dusty deserts? 
Climbing steep rocky canyon roads? 
Sliding down sun-drenched sand dunes? 
Discovering remote pathways in natural grasslands? 
Nevertheless, they did end up in the parking spots here in Berlin. 

What drove them here?
