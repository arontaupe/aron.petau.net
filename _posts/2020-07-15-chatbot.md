# Guru to Go
## a speech-controlled meditation assistant and sentiment tracker

{% include video id="R73vAH37TC0" provider="youtube" %}

Here, you see a Demo video of a Voice-controlled meditation assistant that we worked on in the course "Conversational Agents and speech interfaces"

The Chatbot was built in Dialogflow, with a Python Backend. It runs in Google Assistant and can adaptively deliver meditations, visualize sentiment history and comprehensively inform about meditation practices

Attached below you can also find our final report with details on the programming and thought process.


## Sommerblut

Natural Language Understanding really fascinates me and currently, I also collaborate with the team of the Sommerblut Festival in Cologne to deliver them a customized chatbot that will be able to communicate with everyone, respecting accessibility standards to really include all people. It will be able to communicate in German Sign Language (DGS), as well as service blind people, and we aim to incorporate the simple language concept. 

This is a work in progress, come check again after March 6th, when the 2022 festival started.
