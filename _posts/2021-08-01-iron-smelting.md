# Iron Smelting
## Impressions from the International Smelting Days 2021

## The concept
TODO

## Building a furnace

Here you can see a timelapse of me building a version of an Iron Furnace

As you can see, we are using some quite modern materials, such as bricks, this is due to the time constraints of the ISD. Making an oven completely from scratch is a much more lengthy process.

## Apply heat
After, the furnace is dried and heated up

Over the course of the process, more than 100 kgs of coal are used.

## Final Stage: 
### Opening the furnace and refining the product
