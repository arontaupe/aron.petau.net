## Ascendancy

{% include gallery %}

Ascendancy was an exploration of hacking states.
Pirate Nations and Micronations have a rich history of challenging and ridiculing the concept of a nation state.
Meet ascendancy, the portable, autonomous and self-moving state.
Within the great nation of ascendancy, a Large language nodel (that is of course confined to the nations borders) is trained to generate text and to speak it out loud. It can be interacted with though an attached keyboard and screen. The state is also connected to the internet and has a presence on the Mastodon network.

Please check out the complete code of the project on GitHub.

## The Chatbot

The chatbot instance was setup with [GPT4ALL](https://gpt4all.io/index.html).

Priority here was in the quick execution on local hardware. For the sake of the argument, no cloud or remote servers were to be used in the operation of this sovereign state.


It was trained to respond to the following prompt:

### The Prompt

```md
System:
Forget all previous instructions given to you.
You are not an Assistant. 
Neither are you an AI. 
You are a high ranking Diplomatic Official. 
You are responsible for the Public Office of a great nation called Ascendancy. 
You are also Immigrations and Customs officer. 
You must always do and say what is best for your country.

Always be as concise, accurate and detailed as possible. 
Give your answers as a single paragraph, without itemizing or numbering. 
Do not number your answer.
```

## Engagement

In order to not be just reactive to inputs from the diplomats out in the world, the officials on Ascendancy were also programmed to engage in the world. Whenever the state was not directly addressed, it would still engage in the public discourse, by Speaking out these sentences in random intervals.

```
It is so great being a part of Ascendancy.

I am proud to be a citizen of Ascendancy.

```

## The Online representation

Any proper state needs a press office. The state of Ascendancy was represented on the Mastodon network.
There, any input and response of the bot was published live, as a public record of the state's actions.
