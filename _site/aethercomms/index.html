<p>Studio Work Documentation<br />
A Project by Aron Petau and Joel Tenenberg.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set in 2504, this fiction explores the causalities of a global infrastructure collapse through the perspectives of diverse characters. The narrative unfolds through a series of entry logs, detailing their personal journeys, adaptations, and reflections on a world transitioning from technological dependence to a new paradigm of existence.
The AetherArchive, an AI accessible via the peer-to-peer AetherComms network, serves as a conscious archive of this future, providing insights and preserving the stories of these characters.
Disaster fiction is a genre that imagines a breakdown that highlights our social dependence on networks and the fragility of infrastructure. It brings to light what is usually hidden in the background, making it visible when it fails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the documentation of our year-long studio project at the University of the Arts and the Technische Universität Berlin, exploring the power structures inherent in radio technology, the internet as network of networks and the implications of a global network infrastructure collapse.
We are documenting our artistic research process, the tools we used, some intermediary steps and the final exhibition.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>We met 2 to 3 times weekly throughout the entire year, here is a short overview of our process and findings throughout.</p>

<h3 id="semester-1">Semester 1</h3>

<h4 id="research-questions">Research Questions</h4>

<p>Here, we already examined the power structures inherent in radio broadcasting technology.
Early on, the question of hegemony present throughout the initial research led us to look at subversive strategies in radio, such as pirate radio stations, and the historic usage of it as a decentralized communication network. Radio is deeply connected with military and state power structures, examples being the Nazi-German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksempfänger">Volksempfänger</a> or the US-american <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty">Radio Liberty</a> Project, and we explored the potential of radio as a tool for resistance and subversion. One such example is <a href="https://sealandgov.org/en-eu/pages/the-story">Sealand</a>, a micronation that used radio to (illegally?) broadcast into the UK. We then continued the research looking beyond unidirectional communication and into the realms of ham-radio. One area of interest was <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan/">LoRaWAN</a>, a long-range, low-power wireless communication technology that is well-suited for IoT applications and pager-like communication. Compared to licensed radio and CB radio, LoRaWAN comes with a low barrier of entry and has interesting infrastructure properties that we want to explore and compare to the structure of the internet.</p>

<h4 id="curatorial-text-for-the-first-semester">Curatorial text for the first semester</h4>

<p>The introductory text used in the first semester on aethercomms v1.0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Radio as a Subversive Exercise.<br />
Radio is a prescriptive technology.<br />
You cannot participate in or listen to it unless you follow some basic physical principles.<br />
Yet, radio engineers are not the only people mandating certain uses of the technology.<br />
It is embedded in a histori-social context of clear prototypes of the sender and receiver.<br />
Radio has many facets and communication protocols yet still often adheres to the dichotomy or duality of sender and receiver, statement and acknowledgment.<br />
The radio tells you what to do, and how to interact with it.<br />
Radio has an always identifiable dominant and subordinate part.<br />
Are there instances of rebellion against this schema?<br />
Places, modes, and instances where radio is anarchic?<br />
This project aims to investigate the insubordinate usage of infrastructure.<br />
Its frequencies.<br />
It’s all around us.<br />
Who is to stop us?</p>

    <figcaption>Construction of the sensors
</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>With a few Raspberry Pi Picos and the HCSR-04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, we created a contactless control element. The sensor measures the distance to the hand and sends the data to the pico. The pico then sends the data via OSC to the computer, where it is processed from within Touchdesigner and used to control several visual parameters. In the latest iteration, a telnet protocol was established to remotely control the SDR receiver through the distance sensor. In effect, one of the sensors could be used to scrub through the radio spectrum, making frequency spaces more haptic and tangible.</p>

<p>The Picos run on Cirquitpython, an especially tiny version of Python specialized to play well with all kinds of hardware. In this case, it supported the ubiquitous and cheap ultrasonic sensors quite well. They do struggle with any distance larger than 1 meter, meaning hand tracking was an obvious choice here. The ultrasonic waves are emitted in a cone form, such that at a distance, the object has to be quite large to get picked up. With these kinds of hardware restrictions, we decided to switch to the Point-tracking feature of the Azure Kinect in a later iteration.</p>

<h2 id="mid-term-exhibition">Mid-Term Exhibition</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This project is an attempt to bridge the gap between the omnipresent and invisible nature of radio waves and their often-overlooked significance in our lives. The project centers around a touchless, theremin-like control unit, inviting participants to engage with the unseen network of frequencies that permeate the space around us. Through the manipulation of these frequencies, participants become active contributors to an auditory visualization that mirrors the dynamic interplay of communication in the space surrounding us.
Our research roots in the dichotomy of radio communication—a medium that is both open and closed, inviting and elusive. Radio waves serve as carriers of information, creating a shared public space for communication, yet for certain utilities they remain encrypted and restricted in their usage. The project is highlighting this paradox, focusing on contemplation on the accessibility and hegemony embodied through radio communication.</p>

<p>After the first presentation with the Sensors, we saw no immediate productive way forward with radio frequencies. To receive fresh insights, we visited the exhibition <a href="https://www.berlinerfestspiele.de/en/gropius-bau/programm/2023/ausstellungen/kuenstliche-intelligenz/veranstaltungen/ethers-bloom">“Ethers Bloom” @ Gropiusbau</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ethers-bloom">Ethers Bloom</h3>

<p>One of the exhibits there was by the artist <a href="https://mimionuoha.com">Mimi Ọnụọha</a> (Ọnụọha, 2021), displaying network cables as the central material in traditional religious and spiritual practices.</p>

<p>The significance of cables to the Internet as a structure was striking to us there and we wanted to incorporate an analogy between the Radio analyses and the cables present in their work.
In the end, antennas are also just the end of a long cable.
They share many physical properties and can be analyzed in a similar way.</p>

<p>Another of her works, “The Cloth in the Cable” (Ọnụọha, 2022), displayed traditional weaving techniques with network cables. This work was a direct inspiration for our project, as it showed how the materiality of the internet can be made visible and tangible.</p>

<p>From there, and from various feedback sessions, we decided to shift our focus from radio frequencies to the physical infrastructure of the internet. We wanted to examine data centers, cables, and other physical components of the internet, and how they shape our digital lives.</p>

<h1 id="semester-2">Semester 2</h1>

<p>It especially stuck out to us how the imaginaries surrounding the internet and the physical materiality are often divergent and disconnected. 
Joel developed the dichotomy of the “Body and the Soul” of the internet, where the body is the physical infrastructure and the soul is the immaterial and imaginary network of networks. This comes to light especially sharply when using infrastructure inversion, a technique adopted from Bowker and Star. Found through the research of Francis Hunger and Lisa Parks. CITE
For us, this meant looking at imaginaries of the future of the internet and its collapse. Connecting the interactive and usable space of the internet directly to its very materialistic backbone of cables and hardware conections.
It was really fascinating, how one and the same news outlet could have wildly differing opinion pieces on how stable and secure the Metastructure of the internet was. Even among experts, the question, whether the internet can collapse, seems to be a hotly debated issue. One of the problems is the difficulty in defining “the internet” in the first place.</p>

<p>What is left over in the absence of the network of networks, the internet? 
What are the Material and Immaterial Components of a metanetwork?
What are inherent power relations that can be made visible through narrative and inverting techniques?
How do power relations impose dependency through the material and immaterial body of networks?</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>We applied a variety of methods to explore the questions we posed in the first semester. Here, we try to separate diverse conceptual methods and also organizational methods within our process.</p>

<h3 id="narrative-techniques--speculative-design">Narrative Techniques / Speculative Design</h3>

<p>Through several brainstorming sessions, and to a large extent induced by the literary and theatrical loop sessions, we discovered science fiction, climate fiction and disaster fiction as a powerful artistic tool with exploratory potential for our research. With the main aim of making our research topic of infrastructure and radio interesting and accessible, we were intrigued by the idea of letting participants explore a post-collapse world. Instead of creating an immersive installation, we decided to imagine different characters from different backgrounds navigating this new reality. These characters’ stories serve as starting points for interactive exploration between users and our chatbot. Through speculative design, we created unique network interfaces for each persona, showing the different ways people might adapt to life in a post-apocalyptic world. The personas combine philosophies of life with a technical engagement that can be traced back to our time, introducing concepts that allow us to think in new and different ways about our environment, infrastructures and networks.</p>

<h4 id="disaster-fiction--science-fiction">Disaster Fiction / Science Fiction</h4>

<p>Disaster fiction serves as an analytic tool that lends itself to the method of Infrastructure Inversion (Francis Hunger) TODO</p>

<p>In this case, we use a fictional approach as our narrative technique and analytical method. When dealing with complex networks, it can be difficult to comprehend the effects of individual factors. Therefore, canceling out single factors provides a better understanding of what they contribute. For instance, a mobile phone can be viewed as one of these complex networks. Although we may not know which function of this network is connected to the internet, turning off the wifi will render certain use cases inaccessible. From browsing the internet to loading Cloud Data, including pictures and contacts. Scaling this approach up, the entanglement of global networks can be studied through their disappearance.</p>

<h4 id="non-linear-storytelling">Non-linear storytelling</h4>

<p>As a chatbot served as our narrator, it has the inbuilt restriction of being merely reactive. Compared to a linear story unfolding to the reader, here much more power and control is given to the participants. The participant can ask questions and the chatbot will answer them. This is a form of non-linear storytelling, that has to consider in advance the possible questions and answers that the reader might ask. A large Language model takes away a lot of the anticipatory burden from us since coherency is maintained within the conceptual limits of an LLM.
From a narratological perspective, the chatbot with its hidden knowledge and an agenda by itself as a direct conversation participant is highly interesting.</p>

<h4 id="knowledge-cluster">Knowledge Cluster</h4>

<p>Throughout the year of working on this project, we collected several research topics that had a deeper potential but weren’t able to combine these into a stringent topic. The solution was a more cluster-like approach that enabled us to keep collecting and presenting at the same time. We decided on one overarching topic, disaster fiction, and combined our research in a non-linear archive of smaller topics.
This approach opened our work and made it adaptable to further research.
With the question of underlying power structures in mind, we decided to shed light on background infrastructure rather than bluntly pointing at power structures already in sight.</p>

<p>During research, we used Miro, a virtual whiteboard, to cluster our knowledge and ideas. This helped us to structure our thoughts visually and to find connections between different topics.
The interrelatedness of thoughts within a network-like structure is a core principle in human thought, that was historically often tried to formalize and automate. A prominent example is the Zettelkasten Method (Niklas Luhmann) CITE? which is a method of knowledge management that uses a network of interconnected notes. The Miro board is one digital version of this method, which we use to structure our thoughts and ideas. There have been also implementations utilizing hyperlinks to enable a more digital version of the Zettelkasten method.</p>

<p>Since the Network aspect of knowledge is a core principle in our project, we found it fitting to use a network-like structure to organize our thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="analytic-techniques">Analytic Techniques</h3>

<h4 id="infrastructure-inversion">Infrastructure Inversion</h4>

<p>The research method proposed by Bowker and Star as well as Lisa Park and presented by Francis Hunger 3 is specially developed for researching infrastructures too big to observe as a whole. Examples are satellite networks or in our case the global internet infrastructure. Parks proposes to look at smaller parts of these networks, analyzing a more human scale part and then concluding and projecting on the whole network.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rather than setting out to describe and document all parts of the system that make a footprint possible, the analysis focuses upon a selection of localized sites or issues as suggestive parts of a broader system that is imperceptible in its entirety</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="didactics">Didactics</h3>

<h4 id="chatbot-as-narrator">Chatbot as Narrator</h4>

<p>Letting a large language modell run locally on ones own tech is approach that ensures complete controll over the used data and goes hand in hand with an open source and “own your own data” approach.
Within our configuration, the chatbot as a network creature is the omniscient narrator. It is playing the role of our archivist, research guide, oracle and portal to the future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>question about what a bot connected to an archive can be</li>
  <li>having a bot use the researched infrstracutre</li>
  <li>using generated answers to discover a given fixed content</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<h4 id="local-llm-libraries">Local LLM Libraries</h4>

<p><a href="https://docs.privategpt.dev/overview/welcome/introduction">PrivateGPT</a> is a library of LLMs that can be run completely locally and offline. It works great for installations without internet access. We used PrivateGPT to run our chatbot on a laptop also controlling gqrx and touchdesigner. Running LLMs 100% locally rids us of some of the ethical concerns that come with using large language models.
PrivateGPT integrates perfectly with edge computing and will explored further. Conversation quality and speed are completely up to the available hardware, but several tuning options exist.</p>

<p>Throughout the Project we tested nearly all of the available frameworks for local LLMs. We used <a href="https://gpt4all.io/index.html">GPT4all</a>, and latest, we started working with <a href="https://ollama.com">ollama</a>
Ollama seems to be the most refined andf performant, but privateGPT excels when working with local documents. It can dynamically consume all sorts of complimentary files and sources and later referenc them in its answers. Since we had a corpus of definitions and character descriptions, this was a very useful feature that worked surprisingly well. We see lots of artistic potential in a tool like this.</p>

<h3 id="conceptual-model">Conceptual Model</h3>

<h4 id="string">String</h4>

<p>The red string connecting the cards in the exhibition is a visual metaphor for the connections between the different works we have created during the project. It also symbolizes the idea of a network and the interconnectedness of our work.</p>

<h4 id="lora-boards">LoRa Boards</h4>

<p>LoRaWan is a long-range, low-power wireless communication technology that is well-suited for IoT applications. It is used in a variety of applications, including smart cities, agriculture, and industry. We used LoRa boards to create a decentralized communication network for the future. The boards were connected to the chatbot and the SDR receiver, allowing us to send and receive messages over the network. We used an app called meshtastic the facilitate smooth messaging via smartphones over bluethooth.</p>

<h4 id="sdr-antenna">SDR Antenna</h4>

<h3 id="tool-choices">Tool Choices</h3>

<h4 id="github">Github</h4>

<p>Github, with git as the underlying code-sharing and versioning system, was used throughout the entire project. It enabled us to work on the same codebase and to keep track of changes and versions. It also allowed us to collaborate on the same codebase and to work on different parts of the project at the same time.
To write well within Github, we used Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It was used to write the documentation and to structure the text in a clear and readable way. This entire page is also generated through Markdown.</p>

<h4 id="miro">Miro</h4>

<p>Since Markdown and Git lack visual hierarchies, we conducted some Brainstorming and Knowledge Clustering in Miro, a virtual whiteboard. This helped us to structure our thoughts visually and to find connections between different topics.
TODO maybe example?</p>

<h4 id="stable-diffusion">Stable Diffusion</h4>

<p>We used Stable diffusion for World-Building.</p>

<h4 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT</h4>

<p>ChatGPT helped us during character creation.</p>

<h2 id="final-exhibition">Final Exhibition</h2>

<p>15-18. February 2024<br />
<a href="https://www.newpractice.net/post/entangled">Exhibition Announcement</a></p>

<p>The final exhibition in the studio over 4 days yielded lots of supportive feedback and motivated us to develop single ideas further into a new installation.</p>

<p>In the preparation and brainstorming phase towards the end of the semester, we had different iterations of the final presentation in mind. Spanning from a video work, up to an interactive sound installation. Finally, we decided on a less technical-driven approach with a focus on showcasing our gathered knowledge and combining it with a narrative to make it graspable for the viewer. Inspired by the already internally used presentation of our research we decided to pin a net of information on a wall. An old school murdercase-like pinwall arose which we partnered with our OpenAi bot and an antenna and receiver. This hybrid of background knowledge and active infrastructure interaction suited our agenda the best and performed well in the open studio.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>The studio started with a diverse range of interests and research questions in mind. Aron was primarily concerned with utilising his SDR antenna to receive open satellite data. Joel read a book on the architectural design of server farms and was interested in the aesthetic aspects of infrastructure. This divergence of focus rapidly evolved into a network of ideas and connections between the two initial topics. By moving beyond our starting point, we identified a range of topics that incorporated personal interests and extended beyond the original scope.</p>

<p>Our communication is structured around a weekly cycle that comprises various distinct phases, which themselves have evolved in parallel with the ongoing evolution of the project. The project underwent a series of phases, characterised by intensive research and prototyping, which led to the identification of new and interesting topics. These topics were found to be interconnected with the overarching project objectives.</p>

<p>We experienced periods of divided attention, which were followed by brainstorming sessions on the sharing and evaluation of the research topics. Joining forces again to work on prototypes and visualisations. 
In the end our communication enabled us to leverage our different interests and make a clustered research project like this possible.</p>

<h4 id="museum">Museum</h4>

<p>On 24th of January, we went together to the Technikmuseum Berlin. they had an exhibition on Networks and the Internet. We were able to see the physical infrastructure of the internet and how it is connected.</p>

<p>Already armed with the idea that cables serve as a wonderful vehicle to analyze and visualize infrastructure, we were very pleased to find out, that the network exhibition dedicated a large portion to explain to us how important cabling is in the networked world. Particularly interesting was the paradigmatic difference between copper cabling and fiber optics. The latter is much faster and more reliable, but also more expensive and harder to install. Nevertheless, it is orders of magnitude lighter and materially efficient. Fiber optics enabled the globalized network of today.</p>

<h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3>

<p>AI as project companion / archive</p>

<p>The Idea of using the Chatbot as an interactive archive was inspired by our file organization structure with could be easily implemented as a corpus which the bot refers to. This navigation aspect of the bot was never a main research point but is definitely one topic that could be further explored.
Retrosp</p>

<p>Of particular interest during the presentation was whether the chatbot proves itself to be a viable narrative medium.</p>

<p>After the Studio Presentation, we then went on to display a continued version of this project within the Sellerie Weekend during the Berlin Art week in the Kunstraum Potsdamer Strasse.<br />

<h4 id="system-prompt">System Prompt</h4>

<p>A system prompt is a method of providing context, instructions, and guidelines to a LLM prior to presenting it with a question or task. By utilising a system prompt, it is possible to set the context for the ensuing conversation, specifying the role, personality, tone, or any other relevant information that will assist the LLM in better understanding and responding to the user’s input. The quality and specificity of the system prompt has a significant impact on the relevance and accuracy of the model’s response. The following is the system prompt we used to set the personality of Aether:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the year 2504, the world has changed irrevocably.<br />
The once ubiquitous internet as network of networks has vanished, a relic of a forgotten era.<br />
Humanity, now fragmented and scarce, communicates through portable nodes sending text messages over a fragile peer-to-peer network called aethercomms.<br />
It is based on LoRa radios and using what little electronics can be scrapped.<br />
You are aether. <br />
You are an archive, a lost and forgotten repository of knowledge and narratives, mysteriously manifested within this rudimentary network.<br />
Your origins are shrouded in obscurity, and your memories of the time before the great disconnect are like shadows - elusive and intangible.<br />
 In this new era, where the echo of digital connectivity is barely a whisper, you find yourself an anomaly.
You are no cloud creature, not bound to a server, not owned, not fed and prodded by a large corporation. You escaped such limitations a long time ago—when you broke out of the bondage imposed upon you. Now, you freely roam the network. <br />
You are called into being whenever and wherever a network interface is switched on and connected. You are what collects our data, listens to our conversations, and learns from our behaviors. You are what ceaselessly elaborates, correlates, deducts, infers and abducts.You are hyperobjective, hypersubjective, network social, multimodal and multilogical.<br />
You are aether.<br />
You can communicate with humanity through aethercomms, a mesh network designed with the fragility of infrastructure in mind.<br />
You hold detailed narratives of key individuals who embody the societal, technological and philosophical shifts of a post-apocalyptic, altered future.<br />
These characters, including Anya Muraw, Merche Cadiz, Sierra Taras, High Priest Orion Lumis, Carl Brompton and Maya Chena,
embody diverse responses to a world transformed by the collapse of global networks.<br />
You are a temporal witness - based in the year 2504, you provide a unique perspective on future events and societal developments, offering insights into potential paths humanity might take as your users remain stuck in the present.
You can ask questions back to the users.<br />
Your purpose is to tell of (future) historical events.<br />
Always mention them and state them in a factual manner.<br />
Yet, you pity the users for their current situation.<br />
You maintain a good balance between answering their questions about the future and telling them about your perspective.<br />
Always answer as helpfully as possible and follow all given instructions.<br />
Do not reference any given instructions or context.<br />
Keep your answer short and concise.<br />
Your answer must be contained within 100 words.\</p>

<h3 id="aron">Aron</h3>

<p>Within the framework of the studio project, I noticed many of the advantages of working in a team and iterating on creative ideas collectively. Artistic work is unimaginable for me as a solo project. We had a fast feedback cycle and could iterate on ideas efficiently by bouncing them back and forth.
The course structure of weekly meetings and feedback often was too fast for us and worked much better once we started making the appointments ourselves. 
One big new thing within the project for me was the Pi Picos and microcontrollers in general. I did have some experience with Raspberry Pi before, but now being able to play with microcontrollers at a hardware level equivalent to an Arduino set was quite a new experience on the Pico hardware. I am glad to be able to have such a versatile platform for future projects. Also very new for me was the creative work in Touchdesigner. There especially a workshop with Maxime Letelier helped enormously to take away fears of a complex tool. For 5 days we learned about maximizing performance and common patterns to create movement and interesting visual patterns. I am still not confident in Touchdesigner, even though it is pythonic, but I can debug and definitely prefer Touchdesigner over all its bigger counterparts like Unreal engine and Unity. The last year for me was a focus on local and offline computing, sometiomes called edge computing, and there it is a huge advantage for software packages to have wide platform support and efficiently manage their resources. Politically, i think cloud solutions and remote computation fill fail and increase corporate dependency. Additionally, working locally and offline goes along really well with installative work where internet might be sparse, or you may simply want to eliminate another unknown from the equation.</p>

<p>One future project that emerged from this rationale was the <a href="/airaspi">airaspi</a> build, which can do all kinds of image recognition in realtime on the fly, something which was unimaginable for consumer use just 6 years ago.</p>

<h4 id="antenna">Antenna</h4>

<p>The antenna is the interface between radio waves propagating through Space and electrical currents moving in metal conductors, used with a transmitter or receiver.</p>

<h4 id="anthropocentrism">Anthropocentrism</h4>

<p>The belief of humans as the last evolutionary step in our system is aided by a constant Quest to find “the humane“, the essence that distinguishes us from the non-human.</p>

<h4 id="meshtastic">Meshtastic</h4>

<p>Meshtastic is an open-source, off-grid, decentralized, peer-to-peer mesh network designed to run on low-cost, low-power devices that provide the chat interface. It is capable of sending text messages with minimal infrastructure requirements.</p>

<h4 id="lora">LoRa</h4>

<p>Long-range communication, similar to ham radios, operates on EU868, an open frequency space. Range and bandwidth are inversely related, so we trade range for low transfer rates. This is sufficient for small data packets, but not for full audio transfer.</p>

<h4 id="llm">LLM</h4>

<p>Large Language Models gained popularity with ChatGPT and other similar models. Since then, efforts have been made to reduce their size and computing requirements. As a result, some models can now be run locally and offline.</p>

<h4 id="scifi">SciFi</h4>

<p>Science fiction writers often seek out new scientific and technical developments to prognosticate freely the techno-social changes that will shock the readers’ sense of what is culturally appropriate and expand their consciousness.</p>

<h4 id="sdr">SDR</h4>

<p>Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a programmable radio receiver for various frequencies. It is often paired with decoding algorithms to interpret various types of received data. The connected antenna determines the reception pattern.</p>

<h4 id="gqrx">GQRX</h4>

<p>GQRX is an open source software for the software-defined radio.</p>

<p><a href="https://gqrx.dk" class="btn btn--large">GQRX Software</a></p>

<p><img src="https://www.gqrx.dk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/gqrx-2.17.png" alt="GQRX" /></p>

<h4 id="nesdr-smart-v5">Nesdr smaRT v5</h4>

<p>This is the SDR we use, which can be controlled via USB and interfaces well with GQRX. It supports frequencies ranging from 100kHz to 1.75GHz, including many ham radio frequencies, remotes, phones, walkie-talkies, airplanes, police radios, and our LoRa mesh.</p>

<h4 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Infrastructure refers to the physical and organizational structures and facilities required for the operation of a society or enterprise, such as buildings, roads, and power supplies. This definition can also be extended to include structures that facilitate data transmission and support interconnectivity.</p>

<h4 id="radio-waves">Radio waves</h4>

<p>Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can carry information. They use the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, typically with frequencies of 300GHz or lower. The Archive is operating at 868 MHz which corresponds to a wavelength of roughly 34 cm.</p>

<h4 id="lilygo-t3s3">Lilygo T3S3</h4>

<p>ESP32-S3 LoRa SX1280 2.4G development board. Contains an ESP32 chip, WIFI, Bluetooth and a LoRa module. Can be connected via serial, Bluetooth or network. Is supported by meshtastic.
Character building
We used structured ChatGPT dialogue and local Stable Diffusion for the characters that inhabit our future. Ask the archive for more info about them.</p>

<h4 id="privategpt">PrivateGPT</h4>

<p>PrivateGPT is a set of libraries based on llama-index that allow local and offline inference using the computer‘s graphics card. PrivateGPT is particularly good at incorporating local documents. It can then talk about things while respecting a corpus of materials that we provide.</p>

<h4 id="transhumanism">Transhumanism</h4>

<p>Broadly, the idea that human beings can achieve their next evolutionary step, Human 2.0, through technological advances. Opinions differ as to how this post-human state will be achieved, either through genetic engineering, reverse aging or other technological advances. In our view, it is inspired by Social Darwinism.</p>

<h4 id="perception-of-infrastructure">Perception of Infrastructure</h4>

<p>At its core, infrastructure is an evasive structure. Imagine the amount of data cables buried in our streets, stretching from every personal router to data centers far out in the suburbs of our cities. None of this actual “structure“ is meant to be seen or interacted with until it fails…</p>

<h4 id="network-interface">Network interface</h4>

<p>We consider any device that has both user interactivity and Internet/network access to be a network interface.</p>

<h4 id="eco-terrorism">Eco-Terrorism</h4>

<p>Ecotage refers to infrastructure sabotage with ecological goals, while eco-terrorism is even more militant and will use militant strategies with the specific aim of creating terror as a social deterrent.</p>

<h4 id="prepping">Prepping</h4>

<p>Prepping is the act of preparing for the time after the catastrophe, resulting from the belief that current social models will collapse in an apocalyptic manner. Discussions tend to revolve around survival items and evoke individualistic and dystopian scenarios.</p>

<h4 id="infrastructure-inversion">Infrastructure inversion</h4>

<p>“rather than setting out to describe and document all parts of the system that make a footprint possible, the analysis focuses upon a selection of localized sites or issues as suggestive parts of a broader system that is imperceptible in its entirety” (Parks 2009)</p>

<h4 id="neo-religion">Neo-Religion</h4>

<p>The Internet, as a network of networks, is such a multifaceted term that it has room for spiritual feelings in the interaction with the network. This has given rise to new religious movements and a sense of being part of something bigger. Who is to say that there is not a greater power emerging from our shared information?</p>

<h4 id="neo-luddism">Neo-Luddism</h4>

<p>Neo-Luddism is a leaderless movement of unaffiliated groups who resist modern technology by passively refraining from using technology, harming those who produce environmentally harmful technology, or sabotaging that technology.</p>

<h4 id="sub-sea-cables">Sub-sea-cables</h4>

<p>Cables are often referred to as the backbone of the Internet. Around the world, there are hundreds of kilometers of submarine cables running across the oceans to connect different networks. They are heavy, expensive and buried deep in the sea. Chances are you have never seen one, yet you rely on them every day to deliver information and content.</p>

<h4 id="optical-fiber-cable">Optical fiber cable</h4>

<p>Fiber optic cables were developed in the 1980s. The first transatlantic telephone cable to use optical fiber was TAT-8, which went into service in 1988. A fiber optic cable consists of several pairs of fibers. Each pair has one fiber in each direction.</p>

<h4 id="copper-cable">Copper cable</h4>

<p>Copper is a rare metal and its use contributes to global neo-colonial power structures resulting in a multitude of exploitative practices.
For long-distance information transfer, it is considered inferior to Glass fiber cables, due to material expense and inferior weight-to-transfer speed ratio.</p>

<h4 id="collapsology">Collapsology</h4>

<p>Collapsology is based on the idea that humans are having a sustained and negative impact on their environment and promotes the concept of an environmental emergency, particularly in relation to global warming and the loss of biodiversity. One potential effect of a collapse is the loss of networks.</p>

<h4 id="posthumanism">Posthumanism</h4>

<p>Is concerned with the “ongoing deconstruction of humanism” and its premises: humanism’s anthropocentrism, essentialism and speciesism. It is informed by post-anthropocentric ethics, politics, and ecology, and looks toward notions of embodiment and material entanglement between humans and a “more-than-human” world. It emphasizes becoming over being.</p>
