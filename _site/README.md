# My Portfolio

Here I host some of my recent work and share it with y'all. Feel free to have a look around.

The Portfolio is built around a static website generator based on ruby. It uses the `jekyll` gem to generate the website. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

This enables me to generate all website entries from markdown files. This way I can easily add new projects and blog posts without having to write HTML.
